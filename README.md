# Albums


A simple application to display Taylor Swift's albums (because I like Taylor Swift's music)

Each section contains Taylor Swift's Album Title, the cover picture for the album and a buy now button/link where one can purchase the Album on Amazon.

```sh
$ cd Albums
$ npm install
$ react-native run-ios
```

**More to come**

- Wire application up with Redux
- Add Authentication
- Use API that supports more artistes
- Write tests
